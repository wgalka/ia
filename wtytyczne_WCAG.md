For text content presentation, the following should be true:

- Foreground and background colors should be user-selectable.
- Text blocks should be no wider than **80** characters (or glyphs), for maximum readability.
- Text should **not be fully justified (e.g., text-align: justify;)**.
- Line height should be at least 1.5 times the text size within paragraphs (e.g., line-height: 1.5;), and at least 2.25 times the text size between paragraphs (e.g., padding: 2.25rem;).
- When the text size is doubled, the content should not need to be scrolled.
