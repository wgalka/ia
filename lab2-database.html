        <h2>Migrations</h2>
        <p>Migration is a way to manage your database schema using PHP code instead of manually creating or modifying
            tables in the database. Migrations act as version control for your database, allowing you to define table
            structures and make changes incrementally over time.</p>

        <p>Find a command in documentation to create migration</p>

        <label><b>Create new migration</b></label><br>
        <textarea rows="1" cols="80"></textarea>

        <p>Each migration file contains two methods:
        <ul>
            <li>up() → Defines the table structure (creates or modifies tables).</li>
            <li>down() → Reverts the changes (drops or restores tables).</li>
        </ul>
        </p>

        <p>We use <code>Schema</code> fasade to manipulate database tables. There are 4 commonly used methods:
        <ul>
            <li><input type="text"> <!--Schema::create()--> - Creates a new table </li>
            <li><input type="text"> <!--Schema::table()--> - Modifies an existing table</li>
            <li><input type="text"> <!--Schema::drop()--> - Drops a table (if it exists, else error should be thrown)
            </li>
            <li><input type="text"> <!--Schema::dropIfExists()--> - Drops a table only if it exists</li>
        </ul>
        </p>

        <p>Each fundamental method generally accepts two arguments. The first argument specifies the name of the table,
            while the second argument is an anonymous function. This function receives a parameter of type Blueprint,
            which serves as a representation of the table structure within the database schema.</p>

        <pre><code class="language-php" data-line="2">return new class extends Migration {
    public function up(): void {
        Schema::create('table_name', function (Blueprint $table) {
           //TODO create columns etc.
        });
    }

    public function down(): void {
        Schema::dropIfExists('table_name');
    }
};
        </code></pre>

        <p>The Blueprint class provides a rich set of methods for defining columns, indexes, and foreign key
            relationships. Through it, developers can define a wide variety of column types such as strings, integers,
            booleans, dates, and more. Additionally, it allows the creation of primary keys, unique constraints,
            indexes, and foreign key relationships that establish associations between tables. Common methods for
            Blueprint class are:
        <ul>
            <li> <input> - Auto-increment primary key</li>
            <li> <input> - VARCHAR column</li>
            <li> <input> - Integer column</li>
            <li> <input> - Boolean columny</li>
            <li> <input> - Long text column</li>
            <li> <input> - Created_at & updated_at columns with date type</li>
            <li> <input> - Adds deleted_at column for soft deletes</li>
            <li> <input> - Foreign key reference</li>
        </ul>
        </p>

        <details>
            <summary>Soft delete</summary>
            Soft deletes allow for the logical deletion of records in a database without actually removing the data from
            the table. This is achieved by marking records as deleted using a special column (usually deleted_at), which
            Laravel automatically manages.
        </details>

        <p>Each function is overloaded so that we can specify additional properties, such as the maximum and minimum
            values for numeric columns or the length of text columns. This provides flexibility to tailor the database
            schema to the specific needs of the application.</p>

        <p>After the migration is prepared, we can invoke the `up` and `down` methods to apply the changes to the
            database.
            Now, follow the steps below to manage your migrations.</p>

        <p>Check the status of the migrations to see if any migrations have already been run. To do this, please run the
            following command:</p>

        <label><b>Check the status of the migrations</b></label>
        <input type="text" placeholder="php artisan ?????????" />

        <p>Once you've checked the status, run all the migrations to apply any pending changes to the database. Use the
            following command:</p>

        <label><b>Run all the migrations</b></label>
        <input type="text" placeholder="php artisan ?????????" />

        <p>If you need to revert the last two migrations, run the following command to rollback the last two migrations:
        </p>

        <label><b>Revert given number of migrations</b></label>
        <input type="text" placeholder="php artisan ??????????" />

        <p>You can run the specific migration file. To do this, use the following command:</p>

        <label><b>Run given migration file</b></label>
        <input type="text" placeholder="php artisan ??????????" />

        <p>In cases where the database schema is compromised or requires a complete reset, it may be necessary to
            destroy the existing database and rebuild it from scratch. To accomplish this, you can execute the following
            command:</p>

        <label><b>Refreshing the Database</b></label>
        <input type="text" placeholder="php artisan ??????????" />

        <h2>Models</h2>

        <p>In Laravel, models are integral components of the framework's Eloquent ORM (Object-Relational Mapping), which
            provides an elegant and expressive way to interact with the application's database. A model in Laravel
            represents a single database table and allows developers to interact with that table as if it were an object
            in their application. The model class serves as a blueprint for retrieving, inserting, updating, and
            deleting records in the corresponding database table, abstracting away much of the raw SQL queries and
            facilitating a more intuitive and object-oriented approach to database operations.</p>

        <p>Each model in Laravel typically extends the Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Model class, inheriting its methods
            and properties that make it easy to perform common database tasks. By associating a model with a database
            table, developers can interact with data using Eloquent methods, such as create(), update(), delete(), and
            find(), which automatically generate and execute the necessary SQL queries. The table associated with the
            model is conventionally named using the plural form of the model's class name (e.g., a User model would be
            associated with a users table).</p>

        <p>Laravel models also provide a convenient way to define relationships between different database tables. These
            relationships—such as one-to-many, many-to-many, one-to-one, and polymorphic relationships—allow for
            seamless interaction between related tables through the model's methods. Additionally, models can be
            customized to include features like mutators and accessors for modifying data when retrieving or saving it,
            scopes for reusable query constraints, and mass assignment protection through properties like $fillable and
            $guarded.</p>


        <p>We can create model with diferent options. There are commands for:</p>

        <label><b>Create a Model</b></label><br>
        <textarea rows="1" cols="80"></textarea>

        <label><b>Create a Model and a Migration</b></label><br>
        <textarea rows="1" cols="80"></textarea>

        <label><mark><b>Create a Model, Migration, and Controller:</b></mark></label><br>
        <textarea rows="1" cols="80"></textarea>

        <label><b>Create a Model with Factory</b></label><br>
        <textarea rows="1" cols="80"></textarea>

        <label><b>Create a Model with Seeder</b></label><br>
        <textarea rows="1" cols="80"></textarea>

        <p>Models should align with the structure and requirements of our seeders, ensuring consistency and proper data
            population. If the model is created first, the seeder should be designed to match the model’s attributes and
            business logic. To achieve this, we can fill our model class with specific properties and methods, such as
            defining the $fillable property for mass assignment, setting relationships with other models, and
            implementing methods like accessors, mutators, and custom functions.</p>

        <h3>Model class fields</h3>

        <pre><code class="language-php">class Post extends Model
{
    protected $table = 'custom_posts_table';  // Specify a custom table name
    protected $primaryKey = 'post_id';  // Specify a custom primary key
    public $timestamps = false;  // Disable timestamps for this model
    protected $fillable = ['title', 'content'];  // Only these fields can be mass-assigned
    protected $guarded = ['id'];  // All fields except 'id' can be mass-assigned
    protected $keyType = 'string';  // Specify a string as the primary key type. By default, Laravel assumes that the primary key is an integer.
    public $incrementing = false;  // Disable auto-increment for the primary key
    protected $dates = ['published_at'];  // Specify custom date fields. If your model contains attributes that should be treated as dates (e.g., created_at, updated_at, or any other custom date fields)
    protected $casts = [ // The $casts property allows you to cast attributes to a specific type when retrieving them from the database. Common types include integer, boolean, float, array, and json
        'is_active' => 'boolean',  // Cast 'is_active' to a boolean
        'data' => 'array',  // Cast 'data' to an array
    ];
}
        </code></pre>

        <details>
            <summary>mass-assigned</summary>
            mass assignment refers to the process of assigning values to multiple attributes of a model at once,
            typically using an array. However, mass assignment can pose a security risk if it's not handled properly.
            Laravel protects against mass assignment vulnerabilities using fillable and guarded properties in models.
        </details>

        <h3>Model class Relationship Methods</h3>

        <h4>One-to-Many</h4>
        <pre><code class="language-php">class Post extends Model
{
    public function comments()
    {
        return $this->hasMany(Comment::class);
    }
}
</code></pre>
        <h4>Many-to-One</h4>
        <pre><code class="language-php">class Post extends Model
{
    public function comments()
    {
        return $this->hasMany(Comment::class);
    }
}
            </code></pre>
        <h4>Many-to-Many</h4>
        <pre><code class="language-php">class Post extends Model
{
    public function tags()
    {
        return $this->belongsToMany(Tag::class);
    }
}          
            </code></pre>

        <h3>Events</h3>

        <p>You can define model events to hook into the lifecycle of a model, such as creating, updating, deleting, etc.
        </p>
        <pre><code class="language-php">class Post extends Model
{
    protected static function booted()
    {
        static::created(function ($post) {
            // Do something after a post is created
        });
    }
} </code></pre>

        <h3>Soft Deletes</h3>
        <pre><code class="language-php">use Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\SoftDeletes;

class Post extends Model
{
    use SoftDeletes;

    protected $dates = ['deleted_at'];  // Define 'deleted_at' as a date field
}
</code></pre>

        <p>Now that we have our models created, we can easily perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations and
            other database interactions using the Eloquent model. By leveraging the powerful features of Laravel’s
            Eloquent ORM, we can create new records, retrieve existing ones, update attributes, and delete entries in
            the database with minimal effort. Our model acts as an interface to the database, allowing us to manage data
            in a structured and efficient manner, while also enabling us to implement complex queries, define
            relationships, and apply business logic directly within the model.</p>


        <h3>Create</h3>

        <pre><code class="language-php">// Example: Create a new Post instance and save it
use App\Models\Post;

$post = new Post();
$post->title = 'My First Post'; // content of title column
$post->content = 'This is the content of my first post.'; // content in content column
$post->save(); // Save to database

// We can also create object by passing array to create() method
$post = Post::create([
    'title' => 'My First Post',
    'content' => 'This is the content of my first post.',
]);

            </code></pre>

        <h3>Read</h3>

        <pre><code class="language-php">
$posts = Post::all(); // get all posts
$post = Post::find(1);  // Retrieves the post with ID = 1
// Example: Get the first Post with a specific title
$post = Post::where('title', 'My First Post')->first();
// Example: Get Posts where 'is_active' is true
$posts = Post::where('is_active', true)->get();
</code></pre>

        <h3>Update</h3>

        <pre><code class="language-php">// Example: Update or create a Post based on a unique attribute
$post = Post::updateOrCreate(
    ['title' => 'My First Post'],  // Search condition
    ['content' => 'Updated content for the first post.']  // New data
);


// Example: Update the content of a specific Post
$post = Post::find(1);  // Find post with ID 1
$post->update([
    'content' => 'This is the updated content for the post.',
]);
</code></pre>

        <h3>Delete</h3>

        <pre><code class="language-php">// Example: Delete a Post by ID
$post = Post::find(1);  // Find post with ID 1
$post->delete();
// Example: Delete a Post with a specific ID
Post::destroy(1);  // Delete the post with ID = 1

// Example: Delete multiple posts
Post::destroy([1, 2, 3]);  // Deletes posts with IDs 1, 2, and 3

// Example: Delete posts where 'is_active' is false
Post::where('is_active', false)->delete();
</code></pre>

        <div class="task">
            In this task, you are required to create Eloquent models for the Products and Reviews tables based on the
            provided schema and constraints. You will need to define the necessary attributes and relationships
            between the models, ensuring proper validation and mass-assignment protection.
        </div>










        <h2>Seeders</h2>

        <p>In Laravel, seeders are classes that facilitate the process of populating a database with initial or sample
            data. They are part of Laravel's database seeding feature, which provides a convenient mechanism for
            inserting predefined records into the database. Seeders are especially useful during development and
            testing, where it is necessary to quickly populate tables with dummy data, ensuring the application
            functions as intended. These classes are stored within the database/seeders directory, and each seeder
            typically contains a run() method, which is executed to insert the specified data. Seeders can be executed
            individually or collectively via Artisan commands, allowing developers to efficiently manage database
            entries.</p>
